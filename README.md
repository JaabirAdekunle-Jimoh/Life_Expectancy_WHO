# Life_Expectancy_WHO

The data set was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). The life expectancy and health factors for 193 countries were collected from the WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website for a period of 15 years (2000-2015).

The data set was explored for relationships, geographical visualization with Python, supervised (regression) and unsupervised (cluster) machine learning, time series analysis, and dashboard creation.
